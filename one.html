It is always a joy when I start writing for you
Hei. It is your birthday. Yes, yours. I am really grateful 
that you have given me your precious time. Hours slip by, 
talking to you.








This one has a lot more than just ten words here until this point
This one has a lot more than just ten words here for now
This one has a lot more than just ten words here now 
This one has a lot more than just ten words here
This has the task of having ten words in total
This line has to have more than eight words
This line is going to have eight words
This line ought to have seven words
This should have more than five 
This should have five word
This has four words
This just three
Left two
You












first
we were
then we weren't
we've been there
no problem
fine


billions of stars
    just one 
    Sun
               You
          just one
delights up many
something I know
not without
You
for
you exist
letting me know





billions of stars

delights up many
  something I know
         not without

  			 for
	      you exist
     to make me know










waiting for you
however I am
nisthuri bhaye pani
you light me

These are words
None capture
You
True
Mere attempt
But total failure

estupit many are
Not you
You


Nothing I say
Ever captures
You
True
I try
Estupit I am



Hours go by
Inevitable end
Trying to expand



























billions of stars		Nothing I utter
    just one 		Ever captures
    Sun		You
               You		true
          just one		I try
delights up many			     estupit I am
something I know			      Nothing I utter
not without				   Ever captures
You								  you
For								 true

Moments turn into hours and hours into days, days into decade
You are kind to give some of these precious moments to me
They have come in many ways and have varied a lot 
But all are one in that it is you who gave them
This is not surprising as you are kind to all
You think otherwise but that changes nothing
You allow me to speak when I should stop
You take all the silence when I do not
These are not meant to be praises
These are who you really are
You bring a storm of calm
But a silent one though
And there you are
Absolute wonder
However things are
But a silent one though
You bring a storm of calm
These are who you really are
These are not meant to be praises
You take all the silence when I do not
You allow me to speak when I should stop
You think otherwise but that changes nothing
This is not surprising as you are kind to all
But all are one in that it is you who gave them
They have come in many ways and have varied a lot
You have given me some of these precious moments to me
Moments turn into hours and hours into days, days into decade
I try to write few to say more but there is you who make me say more
I enjoy the walks we take in the boulevard of our thoughts.
They part to make way for you.
I revel when you let your mind out to let me know how you feel.
When language is the barrier you break it to accommodate me.
How I wish to hear the sound behind those words.
The merry go round we take at times
Or the serene roller coaster [of your feelings]

We privy at times but keep the best for the secret playground.
We privy, a little too much, a little to less.
I fear you can hear my heart beat when I look at you.
My heart beats drown out everything when we meet.
My eyes look [at you ]and know that I have missed you.
We leave knowing not when we meet again but grateful we did.
Watchful box of memory I carry open unable to close
Open box of memory I hold/carry unable to close
I hold you close unable to contain the sparkle that you are.
You turn a plant into a tree, a cold heart into wamn
The glee you do not see in me
Let me break out of this to say that I like you.
The bridge of your words let me in
Your words bridge the 
Kasto kasto lagcha, timi huda, timi k janaula
Ho bhandina kahile kahi tara bhanu pani kasari timi tarselau
Timi ra ma
Timi le you lai hami banayau
Mero bagaicha ma hidchau kahile paani ta kahile raang haldai
Timro parkhaai maa ful haru fulchan

Kahile hidchau ta kahile baschau
Sabhda bina bolchau 
Surya jastai gari aauchau raat ujyaalo paarna
सुर्य जस्तै गरी आउचौ रात उज्यालो पार्न

Kahile haasdai kahile jiskyaudai
कहिले हास्दै कहिले जिस्क्यौदै




Where will you ask me to leave when you hold me tight within
Dherai sal haru bite Bitne chan ajhai
Nasochu ta kasari Sochna man lagcha
Timi afno bata laga Tara gham hataau chaya bani pachyaunechu
timi afno bato laaga tara ghaam  nahaTAoo chaayaa bani pachyaunechu
तिमी आफ्नो बाटो लाग तर घाम  नहटाउ छाया बनी पछ्याउनेछु

तिमि जहाँ भए पनि तिम्रो मुस्कान को [पछाडी/ छाया ] मा लुकी बस्ने छु
तिमि जहाँ भए पनि तिम्रो मुस्कान को [पछाडी/ छाया ] मा लुकी बस्ने छु


sochchu ki kahile sabai dinchu timilai tara डर lagcha ki timro laagi na puglaa

सोच्छु कि कहिले सबै दिन्छु तिमिलाइ तर डर लाग्छ कि तिम्रो लागी न पुग्ला 




Timi ra timro samaya ko laagi dhanya chu, kati
