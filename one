I enjoy the walks we take in the boulevard of our thoughts.
They part to make way for you.
I revel when you let your mind out to let me know how you feel.
When language is the barrier you break it to accommodate me.
How I wish to hear the sound behind those words.
The merry go round we take at times
Or the serene roller coaster [of your feelings]

We privy at times but keep the best for the secret playground.
We privy, a little too much, a little to less.
I fear you can hear my heart beat when I look at you.
My heart beats drown out everything when we meet.
My eyes look [at you ]and know that I have missed you.
We leave knowing not when we meet again but grateful we did.
Watchful box of memory I carry open unable to close
Open box of memory I hold/carry unable to close
I hold you close unable to contain the sparkle that you are.
You turn a plant into a tree, a cold heart into wamn
The glee you do not see in me
Let me break out of this to say that I like you.
The bridge of your words let me in
Your words bridge the 
Kasto kasto lagcha, timi huda, timi k janaula
Ho bhandina kahile kahi tara bhanu pani kasari timi tarselau
Timi ra ma
Timi le you lai hami banayau
Mero bagaicha ma hidchau kahile paani ta kahile raang haldai
Timro parkhaai maa ful haru fulchan

Kahile hidchau ta kahile baschau
Sabhda bina bolchau 
Surya jastai gari aauchau raat ujyaalo paarna
सुर्य जस्तै गरी आउचौ रात उज्यालो पार्न

Kahile haasdai kahile jiskyaudai
कहिले हास्दै कहिले जिस्क्यौदै




Where will you ask me to leave when you hold me tight within
Dherai sal haru bite Bitne chan ajhai
Nasochu ta kasari Sochna man lagcha
Timi afno bata laga Tara gham hataau chaya bani pachyaunechu
timi afno bato laaga tara ghaam  nahaTAoo chaayaa bani pachyaunechu
तिमी आफ्नो बाटो लाग तर घाम  नहटाउ छाया बनी पछ्याउनेछु

तिमि जहाँ भए पनि तिम्रो मुस्कान को [पछाडी/ छाया ] मा लुकी बस्ने छु
तिमि जहाँ भए पनि तिम्रो मुस्कान को [पछाडी/ छाया ] मा लुकी बस्ने छु


sochchu ki kahile sabai dinchu timilai tara डर lagcha ki timro laagi na puglaa

सोच्छु कि कहिले सबै दिन्छु तिमिलाइ तर डर लाग्छ कि तिम्रो लागी न पुग्ला 




Timi ra timro samaya ko laagi dhanya chu, kati 

























Moments turn into hours and hours into days, days into decade
You are kind to give some of these precious moments to me
They have come in many ways and have varied a lot 
But all are one in that it is you who gave them
This is not surprising as you are kind to all
You think otherwise but that changes nothing
You allow me to speak when I should stop
You take all the silence when I do not
These are not meant to be praises
These are who you really are
You bring a storm of calm
But a silent one though
And there you are
Absolute wonder
However things are
कहिले हास्दै कहिले जिस्क्यौदै
धेरै साल हरु बिते बित्ने छन् अझै
You bring a storm of calm
These are who you really are
नसोचु तिमीलाई कसरी सोच्न मन लाग्छ
These are not meant to be praises
You take all the silence when I do not
You allow me to speak when I should stop
You think otherwise but that changes nothing
This is not surprising as you are kind to all
तिमि जहाँ भए पनि तिम्रो मुस्कान को पछाडी म लुकी बस्ने छु
तिमी आफ्नो बाटो लाग तर घाम नहटाउ छाया बनी पछ्याउनेछु
They have come in many ways and have varied a lot
You have given me some of these precious moments to me
सोच्छु कि कहिले सबै दिन्छु तिमिलाइ तर डर लाग्छ कि तिम्रो लागी न पुग्ला 
Moments turn into hours and hours into days, days into decade
I try to write few to say more but there is you who make me say more
